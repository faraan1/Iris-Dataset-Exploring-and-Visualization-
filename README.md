## Task Objective
The primary objective of this script is to perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. This includes:

Loading and inspecting the dataset's structure and basic statistics.

Visualizing the distributions of individual features.

Exploring relationships between pairs of features using scatter plots.

Identifying potential outliers and understanding the spread of data through box plots.
This EDA helps in gaining insights into the dataset before applying any machine learning models.

## Dataset Used
The script utilizes the Iris.csv dataset, which is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It comprises 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three distinct species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four measured features:

Id: A unique identifier for each flower sample.

SepalLengthCm: The length of the sepal in centimeters.

SepalWidthCm: The width of the sepal in centimeters.

PetalLengthCm: The length of the petal in centimeters.

PetalWidthCm: The width of the petal in centimeters.

Species: The categorical variable indicating the species of the iris flower.

## Requirements
To execute this script, you will need the following Python libraries installed in your environment:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Code Description
The Python script performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Reads the Iris.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

Initial Data Inspection:

Prints the full DataFrame.

Displays the dimensions (rows, columns) of the DataFrame (df.shape).

Lists all column names (df.columns).

Shows the first five rows of the dataset (df.head()).

Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts for each column (df.info()).

Generates descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for numerical columns (df.describe()).

Data Visualization: Creates a figure with a 2x2 grid of subplots to visualize the data:

Scatter Plot (Top-Left): Illustrates the relationship between SepalLengthCm and SepalWidthCm.

Histogram (Top-Right): Shows the frequency distribution of SepalLengthCm.

Box Plot (Bottom-Left): Displays the distribution and potential outliers for SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, and PetalWidthCm.

The Bottom-Right subplot is intentionally left empty (axes[1,1].axis("off")).

## Models Applied
This script focuses solely on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. No specific machine learning models (e.g., classification, clustering) are applied in this particular code. The purpose is to understand the dataset's characteristics before any model building phase.

## Key Results and Findings
Based on the typical characteristics of the Iris dataset and the visualizations generated by this script, one would generally observe:

Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width (Scatter Plot): Often shows some clustering, indicating that different species might occupy distinct regions in this feature space. For instance, Iris setosa typically has shorter and wider sepals compared to the other two species.

Sepal Length Distribution (Histogram): Reveals the overall distribution of sepal lengths across all iris flowers. It might show a multi-modal distribution if the species have significantly different sepal lengths, or a more generalized distribution if they overlap.

## Feature Distributions (Box Plot):

Provides a quick summary of the central tendency, spread, and presence of outliers for each numerical feature.

It often highlights that PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm are strong discriminators between species, with Iris setosa having notably smaller petals than Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.

Outliers, if present, would be visible as individual points beyond the whiskers of the box plots.

These initial insights are crucial for subsequent steps like feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning in a machine learning pipeline.
